 Basics of Unity and an Idle Game

In this project I am going through the basics of unity in 2D such as coding how a button works, changing values on screen, and interacting with the user. 
It is simulating an Idle Clicker Game where you are able to click on a button in order to add coins. Once enough coins are gained, the player can then buy more upgrades in order to increase the rate of coins they can get.
